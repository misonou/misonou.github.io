# Preventing from leaving

The `preventLeave` form option can be used to prevent user to navigate away unintentedly.

By turning on the option, user will be prompted by browser when user is trying the leaving the page
after updating any field.

For in-app navigation, the application is required to handle the prompting manually.
Register an event handler to `beforeLeave` event and return a promise that **resolved** when user has accepted to leave,
or **rejected** when user has declined.

The lock will be released when the form is reset.
