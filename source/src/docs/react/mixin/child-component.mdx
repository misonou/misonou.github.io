# Passing mixin to child component

To maintain the correct mixin state, when passing mixin to child components, a `MixinRef` must be passed instead.

```tsx
function Component() {
    const mixin = useFlyoutMixin();
    return <ChildComponent mixinRef={mixin.ref} />;
}
```

And use `useMixinRef` to get the mixin instance in child component:

```tsx
function ChildComponent(props) {
    const mixin = useMixinRef(props.mixinRef);
}
```
