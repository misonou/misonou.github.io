# Dialog result

[`DialogState.open`](:) returns a `Promise` object that will be resolved when the dialog closes,
making it readily able to response to user input.

```javascript
const dialog = createDialog({ /* ... */ });
const result = await dialog.open();
```

By default it will resolve with `undefined`, meaning that there is no specific result
from the dialog.

However, the dialog can be commited with return value using `closeDialog` property in `onRender` callback:

<ReturnValueExample />

> Note that the promise will always resolves to `undefined` if the dialog is forcibly
  closed in cases like losing focus.

> If the `onCommit` option is passed to [`createDialog`](:), the value will be sent to `onCommit`, and
  the result will be forwarded to opener.
