# Customizing dialog

## Dialog body wrapper

Dialog UI structure can be encapsulated by a component and re-use by `wrapper` option:

```tsx
function DialogBody(props: React.PropsWithChildren<DialogRenderComponentProps<any, any>>) {
    return (
        <div>
            {props.children}
        </div>
    );
}

createDialog({
    wrapper: DialogBody
});
```

## Opening and closing animation

In addition to the `className` option, these CSS classes are added to dialog's root element in sequence:

- `.visible`: dialog should be rendered from now on (i.e. should no longer be `display: none`)
- `.open`: added to trigger transitions or animations from initial invisible state to visible state
- `.loading`: added when operation in `onCommit` is in progress (since v0.4.4)
- `.closing`: added when the dialog started to close; dialog will be destroyed until all transitions or animations triggered by the class has ended
