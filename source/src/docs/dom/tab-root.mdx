# Tab-focus container

By default, all focusable elements in the document can be focused sequentially by
pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> keys.

However it is somtimes desirable to limit such behavior so only focusable elements
within a component (e.g. dialog or form) are reachable, which is achievable by [`setTabRoot`](:).

> [`setTabRoot`](:) will not focus element within container.

## Working with brew-js

### `tab-root` attribute

When using `brew-js`, any element with ``tab-root`` attribute is automatically set as a tab-focus container.

```html
<div tab-root></dib>
```

### Flyouts

For flyouts, by default it is a tab-focus container unless `tab-through` attribute:

```html
<div is-flyout tab-through></div>
```

or the `tabThrough` option is present:

```javascript
openFlyout('#flyout', null, { tabThrough: true });
```

## Working with brew-js-react

~~brew-js-react >=0.5.3~~

The [`Mixin.tabRoot`](:) mixin is introduced.

```tsx
<div {...Mixin.use(Mixin.tabRoot)}></div>
```
