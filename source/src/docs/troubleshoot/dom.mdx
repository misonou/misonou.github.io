# Other runtime issues

Here listed major known issues over different versions, listing affected versions and possible workaround.

## Unable to trigger navigation when overriding route parameters on change

~~zeta-dom &lt;=0.5.9~~

```javascript
app.route.watch('view', (value) => {
    if (value === 'some_value') {
        app.route.view = 'another';
    }
});

// should be cancelled and trigger another navigation
app.route.view = 'some_value';
```

If upgrade is not plausible, change the update to asynchronous:

```javascript
app.route.watch('view', (value) => {
    if (value === 'some_value') {
        setImmediate(() => {
            app.route.view = 'another';
        });
    }
});
```

## Animation sequence not working

~~brew-js 0.6.0-0.6.4~~ ~~brew-js-react 0.5.0-0.5.5~~

Animation sequence may not work if `zeta-dom` is installed with version prior to `0.4.13` because of out-dated dependency list.

To fix the issue, upgrade `zeta-dom` to `0.4.13`.

## Event listener bound to parent element not working after Chrome updated to version 117

~~zeta-dom &lt;=0.3.14~~ ~~zeta-dom &lt;=0.4.6~~

Chrome 117 introduced experimetal extension to the `Iterator` base type that affects
event emitting mechanism.

To fix the issue, upgrade `zeta-dom` to `0.3.15` or `0.4.7`.
