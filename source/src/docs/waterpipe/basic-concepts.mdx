# Pipe, statement and template

From a simple waterpipe templating example:

<WaterpipeExample
    data={{ value: 1 }}
    template={`
{{if value odd}}
    The value is {{value}}
{{/if}}`}
/>

A **pipe** is a single expression that returns data, as `{{value}}` outputs `1` in the above example.

A **statement**, on the other hand, provides flow controls, like the `{{if ...}}` statement above.

A **template** consists of one or more pipes or statements, as well as raw output (such as the
phrase `The value is` in the above example).
