# Snapshots

~~0.4.9~~

Snapshots can be taken for history storage by [`app.snapshot()`](:).

When snapshot is taken, a new entry is pushed to browser history, where user can go back and forward.

Entries in current [`app.historyStorage`](:) are cloned, and upon user navigation
the previous history storage will be restored.
