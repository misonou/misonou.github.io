# Rendering views

Use [`renderView`](:) to specify a list of views to render.

The views are matched in the provided order, using the [`isViewMatched`](:) predicate. If there is no view matches current path, it will automicatically redirects the SPA to the proper path which renders the first view.

```tsx
import { renderView } from "brew-js-react";
import { Home, Foo } from "./views";

function App() {
    return renderView(Home, Foo);
}
```

## Restricting accessible views

It is possible to restrict which views can be accessed under certain state:

```tsx
import { renderView } from "brew-js-react";
import { Home, Login, ProductInfo, ProductEditor } from "./views";

function App() {
    const [role, setRole] = useState();
    switch (role) {
        case 'editor':
            return renderView(Home, ProductInfo, ProductEditor, Admin);
        case 'reader':
            return renderView(Home, ProductInfo);
        default:
            return renderView(Login);
    }
}
```

## Initial loader

~~0.6.5~~

Now it is possible to show a loader screen before a `import()`-ed view component is loaded.

```tsx
import { renderView } from "brew-js-react";
import { Home, Foo } from "./views";

function App() {
    return renderView({ loader: <div>Loading...</div> }, Home, Foo);
}
```

> It will only be shown when [`renderView`] is first mounted. In subsequent navigation,
  the current view will stay until the next view component is loaded.
