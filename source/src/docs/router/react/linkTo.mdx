<Module name="brew-js-react" />

# linkTo

Returns a link usable in `href` attribute or method such as `window.open`
that when visiting the link through browser the specifed view will be rendered.

This function wraps [`resolvePath`](:) with [`app.toHref`](:).
The returned link will depend on `urlMode` and related options initializing the router.
When `urlMode` is set to `none`, [`navigateTo`](:) should always be used instead as
navigation through link is disabled in such case.

## Syntax

```javascript
linkTo(view)
linkTo(view, params)
```

### Parameters

<dl>
    #### `view`
    A view component created by [`registerView`](:).

    #### `params` <Badge.Optional />
    Extra route parameters that supplements or overrides current route parameters,
    or a tuple containing such route parameters as well as query string and hash.

    > See [here](/docs/router/react/resolvePath#s-passing-query-and-hash) for usage of tuple.
