# resolvePath

Returns the app path that will render the specified view.

The pathname is resolved using route parameters given to [`registerView`](:),
current route parameters, as well as any supplemeneted route parameters
against registered routes in [`app.routes`](:).

This is used by methods such as [`linkTo`](:) and [`navigateTo`](:).

## Syntax

```javascript
resolvePath(view)
resolvePath(view, params)
```

<ImportHint
    name="resolvePath"
    module="brew-js-react"
    require="resolvePath"
    global="brew.react.resolvePath" />

### Parameters

<dl>
    #### `view`
    A view component created by [`registerView`](:).

    #### `params` <Badge.Optional />
    Extra route parameters that supplements or overrides current route parameters,
    or a tuple containing such route parameters as well as query string and hash.

</dl>

## Passing query and hash

~~0.6.4~~

It is able to pass query and hash directly to [`resolvePath`](:):

```javascript
resolvePath(MyView, [{ id: 1 }, '?filter=foo', '#hash']);
```

Any entries in the tuple can be omitted:

```javascript
resolvePath(MyView, [, , '#hash']);
```

It is also possible to provide object literal or `URLSearchParams` for query:

```javascript
resolvePath(MyView, [, { filter: 'foo' }]);
resolvePath(MyView, [, new URLSearchParams({ filter: 'foo' })]);
```
