# Event types

## Async handleable event

An event is **asynchronously handleable**, when either
- `handleable` option is unspecified or is `true`
- `asyncResult` option is unspecified or is `true`

Listener can:
- return value or a `Promise` object, or;
- pass value or a `Promise` object to [`ZetaEvent.handled`](:)

The event will be marked as handled once a listener has return or pass a value, and
subsequent event handlers for the same target, or event handlers for parent targets if the event bubbles up,
will not be called.

> Returning `undefined` is the same as being not handling the event, use `e.handled()` to return an `undefined` value.

Emitter will receives:
- A promise that resolves to the value or fulfilled value from the `Promise` object that listener has returned or passed; or
- `undefined` if there is no listener has done so.

## Sync handleable event

An event is **synchronously handleable**, if
- `handleable` option is unspecified or is `true`
- `asyncResult` option is `false`

Listener can return value as required by the emitter.

Emitter will receives:
- Value, other than `undefined`, returned from listener
- `undefined` if there is no listener has done so.

## Unhandleable event

An event is **unhandleable**, if `handleable` option is `false`.

Any returned value from listener will be discarded, and `e.handled()` will have no effects.

Emitter will always received `undefined` as the result.

## Deferrable event

~~0.5.6~~

An event is **deferrable**, if `deferrable` option is `true`.

Listener can defer operation from emitter by passing promise(s) to `e.waitFor()`.

Just like an unhandleable event, any returned value from listener will be discarded, and `e.handled()` will have no effects.

However, emitter will always receive a `Promise` object that resolves after
all promises passed to `e.waitFor()` has settled.
