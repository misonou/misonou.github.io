<Module name="zeta-dom/dom" />

# retainFocus

Allows focus delegation to another element that is not a descenant of the source element.

Once delegated, the target element can be focused while the source element remains in
focused state (i.e. [`focused`](:) will still return true, and no `focusout` event will be fired.).

Focus delegation can be cancelled by [`releaseFocus`](:).

## Syntax

```javascript
retainFocus(source, target)
```

<ImportHint
    name="retainFocus"

### Parameters
