# Extending app interface

You can also define additional property members and methods as an instance and
define it during app initializtion by [`app.define`](:).

```typescript
import brew from "brew-js/app";

interface AppContext {
    myProp: string;
    myAction(): void;
};

brew<AppContext>.with(appContext)((app) => {
    app.define({
        myProp: '',
        myAction() {
            /* ... */
        }
    });
});
```

You can also predefine the extra properties and method as a seperate object and supply it to `brew.with`.
However it is more likely prone to circular type inference issue in TypeScript.

```typescript
import brew from "brew-js/app";

const appContext = {
    myProp: 'myValue'
    myAction() {
        /* ... */
    }
};

brew.with(appContext)((app) => {
    app.myAction();
});
```
