# Exposing user identity

By casting the extension with specific user object type, [`app.user`](:) will be enforced with the given type.

> If there are multiple identity providers, it may be advantageous to unify the user object by `resolveUser`.

```typescript
import brew from "brew-js/app";
import Router from "brew-js/extension/router";
import Auth, { AuthExtension } from "@misonou/brew-extension-auth";

interface User {
    id: string;
    /* ... */
}

brew.with(Router, Auth as AuthExtension<User>)(app => {
    app.useAuth({
        /* ... */
        resolveUser() {
            // require to return an object of type `User`
            return createMyUserObject();
        }
    });
});
```
